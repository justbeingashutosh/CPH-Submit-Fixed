# CPH Submit Fixed
This is my first browser extension. A naively created form of the original [CPH Submit](https://github.com/agrawal-d/cph-submit) that just might work for you.

## Installation Guide
1. Please download the extension from here.
2. Open the downloaded file with your browser.
A prompt warning you of the extension may appear. This is because most browsers check whether the extension was downloaded from a web store to trust it.
But it is completely safe (you can see the source code). So agree to the prompt and install it.
Now your codeforces submissions just got faster. Keep grinding to push throught those ranks!
All the best :)
